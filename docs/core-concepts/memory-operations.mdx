# Core Operations

Mem0 Supabase Edition provides a simple API for managing complex cognitive states. All operations are tenant-aware and security-first.

## ➕ Adding Memories (Surprise-Driven)

When you add a memory, Mem0 performs a "Cognitive Metabolism" check:
1.  **Expected Info**: If the fact is already known, it increments the `reinforcement_count` of the existing memory instead of creating noise.
2.  **Surprising Info**: If the fact is novel, it is encoded and potentially tagged as a `is_flashbulb` memory.

```python
from mem0 import Memory

m = Memory()

# This new fact will be encoded as a 'Flashbulb' memory
m.add("I'm planning a trip to Lisbon next month.", user_id="alex")

# If you repeat similar info, Mem0 just reinforces the existing entry
m.add("Don't forget my Lisbon trip!", user_id="alex") 
```

## 🔍 Searching & Recollecting

There are two ways to retrieve memories: standard **Search** and the advanced **Recollection Engine**.

### Standard Search & Resonance
Best for simple semantic retrieval. Results automatically include the **Subconscious Context** (real-time resonance) and the **Persona Identity** (Layer 12) if enabled.

```python
results = m.search("What have I learned today?", filters={"user_id": "alex"})

# Access direct results
for mem in results["results"]:
    print(mem["memory"])

# Real-time awareness from other agents
resonance = results.get("subconscious_context", [])

# The agent's persistent meta-identity (The Ego)
persona = results.get("persona_identity")
```

### Advanced Recollection
The **11th Layer** of our architecture. It balances similarity, importance, and recency. Like search, it also passes through the **Persona Identity**.

```python
# The Recollection Engine unifies all cognitive signals
recalled = m.recollection.recollect("core values", limit=5)

# Current distilled personality (The Ego)
current_ego = recalled.get("persona_identity")
```

### Identity Synthesis (Layer 12) 🎭
You can trigger the agent to reflect on its own identity and evolve its persona based on its memory history.

```python
# Distills current behavioral traits into 'identity' memory
# Requires enable_ego=True in MemoryConfig
persona = m.synthesize_identity(user_id="alex")
print(f"Synthesized Persona: {persona}")
```

## 🕰️ Time-Travel (Temporal Memory)

Query your memories as they existed at a specific point in time.

```python
from mem0.temporal import TemporalMemory
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

tm = TemporalMemory()

# What did I know two weeks ago?
state = tm.get_memories_at("alex", days_ago=14)
```

## 🕸️ Graph Jumps

If you have enabled Graphic Memory, connections between entities are created automatically.

```python
# The Recollection Engine can also jump to related concepts
recalled = m.recollection.recollect("Lisbon", enable_graph_jump=True)
print(recalled["associations"]) # Shows things related to Lisbon (Portugal, Past Trips, etc.)
```

## 🧹 Deleting & Resetting

```python
# Delete a specific memory
m.delete("memory_uuid")

# Reset everything for a user (Careful!)
m.reset(user_id="alex")
```
