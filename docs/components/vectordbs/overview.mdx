</CardGroup>

## Why Supabase Only?

This edition is optimized for:
- **Zero External Dependencies**: No need for Qdrant, Pinecone, or other vector DB services.
- **Hybrid Search**: Combines vector similarity with keyword search using RRF.
- **Graph-on-Postgres**: Knowledge graph without Neo4j.
- **Row Level Security**: Native Supabase RLS for multi-tenant applications.
- **Serverless Ready**: Works in Edge Functions and Lambda environments.

## Usage

Set your connection string in the environment:

```bash
export SUPABASE_CONNECTION_STRING="postgresql://postgres:password@host:5432/postgres"
```

For configuration details, see [Supabase Config](/components/vectordbs/dbs/supabase).

## Common issues

### Using Model with Different Dimensions

If you are using a customized model with different dimensions other than 1536 (for example, 768), add `"embedding_model_dims": 768` to the config of the vector_store.
